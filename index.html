        <h2>My Journey to Become a Web Developer</h2>
        <p>When I first started learning about web development, I had no idea what I was getting into. I was fascinated by the idea of creating websites and applications that could be accessed by anyone in the world, but I had no experience in coding or design.</p>
        <p>Over the past three weeks, I've been on a journey to become a web developer. I started with HTML and learned how to create the structure and content of a website with HTML elements. It was challenging at first, but I soon got the hang of it.</p>
        <p>Next, I'll be learning CSS, which will allow me to add style and design to my websites. I'm excited to learn more about this and see how it can enhance the user experience.</p>
        <p>Although I'm still new to web development, I'm already starting to see the possibilities and opportunities that it offers. There's so much to learn and explore, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
